The Infrastructure Data Science and Engineering group uses statistical and machine learning techniques to support Meta’s infrastructure to enable the continued growth in Meta’s apps and products. We partner with engineering teams supporting Meta’s infrastructure, focusing on strategic initiatives that make our infrastructure more efficient, reliable, and scalable. We are full-stack data scientists, responsible for bringing analytical rigor to solving business and technical problems at Meta-scale. We analyze data, design experiments, build models and communicate our results, fostering a culture of data-driven decision making. We are also team players who believe that diverse strengths and perspectives create synergy and maximize our impact. We form close partnerships with engineering teams and deliver results that have direct impact on Meta’s mission and products.
 
Ideal candidates are passionate about Meta’s mission and products, possess **strong analytical** aptitude and coding ability, have excellent collaborative and communication skills, and have hands-on experience working on projects using predictive **modeling**, **pattern mining**, **optimization**, and other quantitative methods.

### Research Data Scientist (University Grad) Responsibilities
> - ***Identify appropriate quantitative methods*** and ***build relevant data sets*** to address challenges across different domains in Meta’s infrastructure.
> - **Develop statistical and machine learning solutions** end-to-end through the full life cycle of prototyping, testing, evaluating, deploying and maintaining them at Meta scale.
> - Develop measurement solutions and experimentation frameworks to ensure effective data-driven decision making. (very confused on this one )
> - **Form close collaborative relationships** with other data scientists and engineering partners and contribute to team projects through model development and analyses.
> - **Communicate** project results and recommendations to stakeholders and cross-functional partners.
### Minimum Qualifications
> - Experience applying **statistical** and **machine learning** techniques such as hypothesis testing, time series analysis, classification, regression, and clustering to real-world data sets.
> - Experience performing data extraction, manipulation, and visualization using programming languages (e.g., Python), scientific computing languages (e.g., R, MATLAB), or **SQL**.
> - Experience with ***at least one programming language*** (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
> - Experience with scientific computing and analysis packages such as ***NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, dplyr, caret***.
