About the job
Role

Data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at Tesla. We rely on data – lots of it – to improve manufacturing, to optimize hardware designs, to proactively detect faults, and to optimize load on the electrical grid.

We're a small but fast-growing team which is building and operating the new data pipelines in the manufacturing environment at Tesla. We collect massive amounts of IoT data, provide storage, access, and high-volume processing. Our stack is built on top of open source technologies, including Spark, Kafka, and related.

We're looking for a talented engineer to join us as a foundational member of the team to deliver new and improved big data services and infrastructure. Your work will affect many hundreds of Tesla engineers daily, as well as improving the functionality of our cars, chargers, and batteries worldwide.
